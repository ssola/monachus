Monachus
========

Library to handle any kind of text in any language and alphabet. Every single PHP developer knows about the troubles to work with different languages and charsets. For example, imagine do you want to find a substring
inside a primary string, but that string is written in Japanese or Arabic. You can't use the common tools (strlen, substr, ...) because PHP (at the moment) doesn't have a good UTF-8 support at all. With Monachus
this should be fixed in an easy way.
